Since they were essentially always visible in Ada 83, this change has no effect. The reason for this change is that the definition in Ada 83 was confusing, and not quite correct, and we found it difficult to fix. For example, one wonders why an ',(0,a.kt)("code",null,(0,a.kt)("a",{href:"../AA-5/AA-5.3#S0175"},"if_statement")),' was not a basic operation of type Boolean.
