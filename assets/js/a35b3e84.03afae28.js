An Ada Issue (AI) is a numbered ruling from the ARG. Ada Issues created for Ada 83 are denoted as "AI83", while Ada Issues created for Ada 95 are denoted as "AI95" in this document. Similarly, Ada Issues created for Ada 2005 are denoted as "AI05" The Ada Commentary Integration Document (ACID) is an edition of the Ada 83 RM in which clearly marked insertions and deletions indicate the effect of integrating the approved AIs. The Uniformity Rapporteur Group (URG) issued recommendations intended to increase uniformity across Ada implementations. The functions of the URG have been assumed by the ARG. A Uniformity Issue (UI) was a numbered recommendation from the URG. A Defect Report and Response is an official query to WG9 about an error in the standard. Defect Reports are processed by the ARG, and are referenced here by their ISO numbers: 8652/nnnn. Most changes to the Ada 95 standard include reference(s) to the Defect Report(s) that prompted the change.
