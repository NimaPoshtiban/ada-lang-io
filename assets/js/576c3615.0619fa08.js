One conceivable existing use of S'Base for nonscalar types is S'Base'Size where S is a generic formal private type. However, that is not generally useful because the actual subtype corresponding to S might be a constrained array or discriminated type, which would mean that S'Base'Size might very well overflow (for example, S'Base'Size where S is a constrained subtype of String will generally be 8 * (Integer'Last + 1)). For derived discriminated types that are packed, S'Base'Size might not even be well defined if the first subtype is constrained, thereby allowing some amount of normally required \"dope\" to have been squeezed out in the packing. Hence our conclusion is that S'Base'Size is not generally useful in a generic, and does not justify keeping the attribute Base for nonscalar types just so it can be used as a ",(0,a.kt)("code",null,(0,a.kt)("a",{href:"../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093"},"prefix")),".",(0,a.kt)("br",null)),(0,a.kt)("h4",h({},{id:"extensions-to-ada-83"}),"Extensions to Ada 83"),(0,a.kt)(l.Z,{type:"aarm",aarm:"note",title:"Note: ",mdxType:"Admonition"},"The attribute S'Base for a scalar subtype is now permitted anywhere a ",(0,a.kt)("code",null,(0,a.kt)("a",{href:"../AA-3/AA-3.2#S0028"},"subtype_mark"))," is permitted.
