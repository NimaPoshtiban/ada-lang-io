Since T1 might have a priority that is higher than the ceiling of the protected object, T1 cannot, in general, do the reordering. One way to implement this is to wake T2 up and have T2 do the work. This is similar to the disentangling of queues that needs to happen when a high-priority task aborts a lower-priority task, which might have a call queued on a protected object with a low ceiling. We have an Implementation Permission in D.4 to allow this implementation. We could have required an immediate priority change if on a ready queue during a protected action, but that would have required extra checks for ceiling violations to meet Bounded (Run-Time) Error requirements of D.3 and potentially could cause a protected action to be abandoned in the middle (by raising Program_Error).
