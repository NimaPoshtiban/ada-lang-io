In some cases, previously ambiguous membership expressions will now have an unambiguous meaning. If an Ada 2012 implementation chose the "wrong" meaning, the expression could silently change meaning. Virtually all such expressions will become illegal because of type mismatches (and thus be incompatible, not inconsistent). However, if the choices are all of a Boolean type, resolution might succeed. For instance, A in B | C and D now always means (A in B | C) and D, but the original Ada 2012 syntax would have allowed it to mean A in B | (C and D). If a compiler allowed the expression and interpreted it as the latter, the meaning of the expression would silently change. We expect this to be extremely rare as membership operations on Boolean types are unlikely (and this can happen only in code written for Ada 2012).
