This change is intended to simplify the implementation of "+" and "" (allowing them to depend on overflow for detecting when to raise Time_Error) and to allow local time zone information to be considered at the time of Split rather than Clock (depending on the implementation approach). For example, in a POSIX environment, it is natural for the type Time to be based on GMT, and the results of procedure Split (and the functions Year, Month, Day, and Seconds) to depend on local time zone information.
