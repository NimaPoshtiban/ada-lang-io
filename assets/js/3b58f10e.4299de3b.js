Similarly, the convention of the anonymous access type of an object is that of the object (again, in Ada 2012 it was Ada). While this is formally incompatible, it should be more useful in portable code; it makes little sense to have a component of an Ada access type in a record with a C convention. For most implementations, this will have no real effect as convention Ada anonymous access types were allowed as C-compatible anyway. But such code was not portable, as this was not required in Ada 2012.
