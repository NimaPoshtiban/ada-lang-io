Note that predefined operators such as "+" have an unconstrained result subtype (see 4.5.1). Note that generic formal functions do not have static result subtypes. Note that the result subtype of an inherited subprogram need not correspond to any nameable subtype; there is still a perfectly good result subtype, though.
