It provides facilities and specifies documentation requirements that relate to several needs: </p><p>Understanding program execution;</p><p>Reviewing object code;</p><p>Restricting language constructs whose usage might complicate the demonstration of program correctness </p><p>Execution understandability is supported by pragma Normalize_Scalars, and also by requirements for the implementation to document the effect of a program in the presence of a bounded error or where the language rules leave the effect unspecified. </p><p>The pragmas Reviewable and Restrictions relate to the other requirements addressed by this Annex. </p><p>NOTE   The Valid attribute (see 13.9.2) is also useful in addressing these needs, to avoid problems that could otherwise arise from scalars that have values outside their declared range constraints.</p><p>Discussion: The Annex tries to provide high assurance rather than language features. However, it is not possible, in general, to test for high assurance. For any specific language feature, it is possible to demonstrate its presence by a functional test, as in the ACVC. One can also check for the presence of some documentation requirements, but it is not easy to determine objectively that the documentation is &quot;adequate&quot;. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="extensions-to-ada-83">Extensions to Ada 83<a class="hash-link" href="#extensions-to-ada-83" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This Annex is new to Ada 95. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="h1--pragma-normalize_scalars">H.1  Pragma Normalize_Scalars<a class="hash-link" href="#h1--pragma-normalize_scalars" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This pragma ensures that an otherwise uninitialized scalar object is set to a predictable value, but out of range if possible. </p><p>Discussion: The goal of the pragma is to reduce the impact of a bounded error that results from a reference to an uninitialized scalar object, by having such a reference violate a range check and thus raise Constraint_Error. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="syntax">Syntax<a class="hash-link" href="#syntax" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The form of a pragma Normalize_Scalars is as follows: </p><p>  pragma Normalize_Scalars; </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="post-compilation-rules">Post-Compilation Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#post-compilation-rules" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Pragma Normalize_Scalars is a configuration pragma. It applies to all compilation_units included in a partition. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="documentation-requirements">Documentation Requirements<a class="hash-link" href="#documentation-requirements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If a pragma Normalize_Scalars applies, the implementation shall document the implicit initial value for scalar subtypes, and shall identify each case in which such a value is used and is not an invalid representation. </p><p>To be honest: It&#x27;s slightly inaccurate to say that the value is a representation, but the point should be clear anyway. </p><p>Discussion: By providing a type with a size specification so that spare bits are present, it is possible to force an implementation of Normalize_Scalars to use an out of range value. This can be tested for by ensuring that Constraint_Error is raised. Similarly, for an unconstrained integer type, in which no spare bit is surely present, one can check that the initialization takes place to the value specified in the documentation of the implementation. For a floating point type, spare bits might not be available, but a range constraint can provide the ability to use an out of range value.</p><p>If it is difficult to document the general rule for the implicit initial value, the implementation might choose instead to record the value on the object code listing or similar output produced during compilation.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="implementation-advice">Implementation Advice<a class="hash-link" href="#implementation-advice" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Whenever possible, the implicit initial value for a scalar subtype should be an invalid representation (see 13.9.1). </p><p>Discussion: When an out of range value is used for the initialization, it is likely that constraint checks will detect it. In addition, it can be detected by the Valid attribute.</p><p>NOTE 1   The initialization requirement applies to uninitialized scalar objects that are subcomponents of composite objects, to allocated objects, and to stand-alone objects.

If a check is implicit in the form of machine instructions used (such an overflow checking), this should also be covered by the documentation. It is particularly important to cover those checks which are not obvious from the source code, such as that for stack overflow.</p><p>An identification of any construct with a language-defined check that is recognized prior to run time as certain to fail if executed (even if the generation of runtime checks has been suppressed); </p><p>Discussion: In this case, if the compiler determines that a check must fail, the user should be informed of this. However, since it is not in general possible to know what the compiler will detect, it is not easy to test for this. In practice, it is thought that compilers claiming conformity to this Annex will perform significant optimizations and therefore will detect such situations. Of course, such events could well indicate a programmer error.</p><p>For each reference to a scalar object, an identification of the reference as either &quot;known to be initialized&quot;, or &quot;possibly uninitialized&quot;, independent of whether pragma Normalize_Scalars applies; </p><p>Discussion: This issue again raises the question as to what the compiler has determined. A lazy implementation could clearly mark all scalars as &quot;possibly uninitialized&quot;, but this would be very unhelpful to the user. It should be possible to analyze a range of scalar uses and note the percentage in each class. Note that an access marked &quot;known to be initialized&quot; does not imply that the value is in range, since the initialization could be from an (erroneous) call of unchecked conversion, or by means external to the Ada program.</p><p>Where run-time support routines are implicitly invoked; </p><p>Discussion: Validators will need to know the calls invoked in order to check for the correct functionality. For instance, for some safety applications, it may be necessary to ensure that certain sections of code can execute in a particular time.</p><p>An object code listing, including: </p><p>Machine instructions, with relative offsets; </p><p>Discussion: The machine instructions should be in a format that is easily understood, such as the symbolic format of the assembler. The relative offsets are needed in numeric format, to check any alignment restrictions that the architecture might impose.</p><p>Where each data object is stored during its lifetime; </p><p>Discussion: This requirement implies that if the optimizer assigns a variable to a register, this needs to be evident.</p><p>Correspondence with the source program, including an identification of the code produced per declaration and per statement. </p><p>Discussion: This correspondence will be quite complex when extensive optimization is performed. In particular, address calculation to access some data structures could be moved from the actual access. However, when all the machine code arising from a statement or declaration is in one basic block, this must be indicated by the implementation.</p><p>An identification of each construct for which the implementation detects the possibility of erroneous execution; </p><p>Discussion: This requirement is quite vague. In general, it is hard for compilers to detect erroneous execution and therefore the requirement will be rarely invoked. However, if the pragma Suppress is used and the compiler can show that a predefined exception will be raised, then such an identification would be useful.</p><p>For each subprogram, block, task, or other construct implemented by reserving and subsequently freeing an area on a run-time stack, an identification of the length of the fixed-size portion of the area and an indication of whether the non-fixed size portion is reserved on the stack or in a dynamically-managed storage region. </p><p>Discussion: This requirement is vital for those requiring to show that the storage available to a program is sufficient. This is crucial in those cases in which the internal checks for stack overflow are suppressed (perhaps by pragma Restrictions(No_Exceptions)). </p><p>The implementation shall provide the following information for any partition to which the pragma applies: </p><p>An object code listing of the entire partition, including initialization and finalization code as well as run-time system components, and with an identification of those instructions and data that will be relocated at load time; </p><p>Discussion: The object code listing should enable a validator to estimate upper bounds for the time taken by critical parts of a program. Similarly, by an analysis of the entire partition, it should be possible to ensure that the storage requirements are suitably bounded, assuming that the partition was written in an appropriate manner.</p><p>A description of the run-time model relevant to the partition. </p><p>Discussion: For example, a description of the storage model is vital, since the Ada language does not explicitly define such a model. </p><p>The implementation shall provide control- and data-flow information, both within each compilation unit and across the compilation units of the partition. </p><p>Discussion: This requirement is quite vague, since it is unclear what control and data flow information the compiler has produced. It is really a plea not to throw away information that could be useful to the validator. Note that the data flow information is relevant to the detection of &quot;possibly uninitialized&quot; objects referred to above. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="implementation-advice-1">Implementation Advice<a class="hash-link" href="#implementation-advice-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The implementation should provide the above information in both a human-readable and machine-readable form, and should document the latter so as to ease further processing by automated tools. </p><p>Object code listings should be provided both in a symbolic format and also in an appropriate numeric format (such as hexadecimal or octal). </p><p>Reason: This is to enable other tools to perform any analysis that the user needed to aid validation. The format should be in some agreed form.</p><p>NOTE 1   The order of elaboration of library units will be documented even in the absence of pragma Reviewable (see 10.2). </p><p>Discussion: There might be some interactions between pragma Reviewable and compiler optimizations. For example, an implementation may disable some optimizations when pragma Reviewable is in force if it would be overly complicated to provide the detailed information to allow review of the optimized object code.

This implies that objects out of scope at the point of the pragma are inspectable.

If a partition has 100 library units and just one needs Unchecked_Conversion, then the pragma cannot be used to ensure the other 99 units do not use Unchecked_Conversion. Note also that these are restrictions on all Ada code within a partition, and therefore it may not be evident from the specification of a package whether a restriction can be imposed.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="static-semantics-1">Static Semantics<a class="hash-link" href="#static-semantics-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The following restrictions, the same as in D.7, apply in this Annex: No_Task_Hierarchy, No_Abort_Statement, No_Implicit_Heap_Allocation, Max_Task_Entries is 0, Max_Asynchronous_Select_Nesting is 0, and Max_Tasks is 0. <!-- -->[The last three restrictions are checked prior to program execution.]</p><p>The following additional restrictions apply in this Annex.</p><p>Tasking-related restriction:</p><p>No_Protected_Types There are no declarations of protected types or protected objects. </p><p>Memory-management related restrictions:</p><p>No_Allocators There are no occurrences of an allocator.</p><p>No_Local_Allocators Allocators are prohibited in subprograms, generic subprograms, tasks, and entry bodies; instantiations of generic packages are also prohibited in these contexts. </p><p>Ramification: Thus allocators are permitted only in expressions whose evaluation can only be performed before the main subprogram is invoked. </p><p>Reason: The reason for the prohibition against instantiations of generic packages is to avoid contract model violations. An alternative would be to prohibit allocators from generic packages, but it seems preferable to allow generality on the defining side and then place the restrictions on the usage (instantiation), rather than inhibiting what can be in the generic while liberalizing where they can be instantiated. </p><p>No_Unchecked_Deallocation Semantic dependence on Unchecked_Deallocation is not allowed. </p><p>Discussion: This restriction would be useful in those contexts in which heap storage is needed on program start-up, but need not be increased subsequently. The danger of a dangling pointer can therefore be avoided. </p><p>Immediate_Reclamation Except for storage occupied by objects created by allocators and not deallocated via unchecked deallocation, any storage reserved at run time for an object is immediately reclaimed when the object no longer exists. </p><p>Discussion: Immediate reclamation would apply to storage created by the compiler, such as for a return value from a function whose size is not known at the call site. </p><p>Exception-related restriction:</p><p>No_Exceptions Raise_statements and exception_handlers are not allowed. No language-defined runtime checks are generated; however, a runtime check performed automatically by the hardware is permitted.</p><p>Discussion: This restriction mirrors a method of working that is quite common in the safety area. The programmer is required to show that exceptions cannot be raised. Then a simplified run-time system is used without exception handling. However, some hardware checks may still be enforced. If the software check would have failed, or if the hardware check actually fails, then the execution of the program is unpredictable. There are obvious dangers in this approach, but it is similar to programming at the assembler level.</p><p>Other restrictions:</p><p>No_Floating_Point Uses of predefined floating point types and operations, and declarations of new floating point types, are not allowed. </p><p>Discussion: The intention is to avoid the use of floating point hardware at run time, but this is expressed in language terms. It is conceivable that floating point is used implicitly in some contexts, say fixed point type conversions of high accuracy. However, the Implementation Requirements below make it clear that the restriction would apply to the &quot;run-time system&quot; and hence not be allowed. This parameter could be used to inform a compiler that a variant of the architecture is being used which does not have floating point instructions.</p><p>No_Fixed_Point Uses of predefined fixed point types and operations, and declarations of new fixed point types, are not allowed. </p><p>Discussion: This restriction would have the side effect of prohibiting the delay_relative_statement. As with the No_Floating_Point restriction, this might be used to avoid any question of rounding errors. Unless an Ada run-time is written in Ada, it seems hard to rule out implicit use of fixed point, since at the machine level, fixed point is virtually the same as integer arithmetic.</p><p>No_Unchecked_Conversion Semantic dependence on the predefined generic Unchecked_Conversion is not allowed. </p><p>Discussion: Most critical applications would require some restrictions or additional validation checks on uses of unchecked conversion. If the application does not require the functionality, then this restriction provides a means of ensuring the design requirement has been satisfied. The same applies to several of the following restrictions. </p><p>No_Access_Subprograms The declaration of access-to-subprogram types is not allowed. </p><p>No_Unchecked_Access The Unchecked_Access attribute is not allowed.</p><p>No_Dispatch Occurrences of T&#x27;Class are not allowed, for any (tagged) subtype T.</p><p>No_IO Semantic dependence on any of the library units Sequential_IO, Direct_IO, Text_IO, Wide_Text_IO, or Stream_IO is not allowed. </p><p>Discussion: Excluding the input-output facilities of an implementation may be needed in those environments which cannot support the supplied functionality. A program in such an environment is likely to require some low level facilities or a call on a non-Ada feature.</p><p>No_Delay Delay_Statements and semantic dependence on package Calendar are not allowed. </p><p>Ramification: This implies that delay_alternatives in a select_statement are prohibited.</p><p>The purpose of this restriction is to avoid the need for timing facilities within the run-time system.</p><p>No_Recursion As part of the execution of a subprogram, the same subprogram is not invoked.</p><p>No_Reentrancy During the execution of a subprogram by a task, no other task invokes the same subprogram.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="implementation-requirements-2">Implementation Requirements<a class="hash-link" href="#implementation-requirements-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If an implementation supports pragma Restrictions for a particular argument, then except for the restrictions No_Unchecked_Deallocation, No_Unchecked_Conversion, No_Access_Subprograms, and No_Unchecked_Access, the associated restriction applies to the run-time system. </p><p>Reason: Permission is granted for the run-time system to use the specified otherwise-restricted features, since the use of these features may simplify the run-time system by allowing more of it to be written in Ada. </p><p>Discussion: The restrictions that are applied to the partition are also applied to the run-time system. For example, if No_Floating_Point is specified, then an implementation that uses floating point for implementing the delay statement (say) would require that No_Floating_Point is only used in conjunction with No_Delay. It is clearly important that restrictions are effective so that Max_Tasks=0 does imply that tasking is not used, even implicitly (for input-output, say).</p><p>An implementation of tasking could be produced based upon a run-time system written in Ada in which the rendezvous was controlled by protected types. In this case, No_Protected_Types could only be used in conjunction with Max_Task_Entries=0. Other implementation dependencies could be envisaged.</p><p>If the run-time system is not written in Ada, then the wording needs to be applied in an appropriate fashion.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="documentation-requirements-3">Documentation Requirements<a class="hash-link" href="#documentation-requirements-3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If a pragma Restrictions(No_Exceptions) is specified, the implementation shall document the effects of all constructs where language-defined checks are still performed automatically (for example, an overflow check performed by the processor). </p><p>This paragraph was deleted.Implementation defined: Implementation-defined aspects of pragma Restrictions.</p><p>Discussion: The documentation requirements here are quite difficult to satisfy. One method is to review the object code generated and determine the checks that are still present, either explicitly, or implicitly within the architecture. As another example from that of overflow, consider the question of deferencing a null pointer. This could be undertaken by a memory access trap when checks are performed. When checks are suppressed via the argument No_Exceptions, it would not be necessary to have the memory access trap mechanism enabled.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_fY38" id="erroneous-execution">Erroneous Execution<a class="hash-link" href="#erroneous-execution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Program execution is erroneous if pragma Restrictions(No_Exceptions) has been specified and the conditions arise under which a generated language-defined runtime check would fail. </p><p>Discussion: The situation here is very similar to the application of pragma Suppress.
